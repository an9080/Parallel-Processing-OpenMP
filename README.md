# Parallel-Processing-OpenMP

multicore program that uses CYK algorithm to parse a string of symbols. The inputs are a context-free grammar Gin Chomsky Normal Form and a string of symbols. At the end, the program should print YES if the string of symbols can be derived by the rules of the grammar and NO otherwise. Write a sequential program (no OpenMP directives at all) as well.
